Poem

The old library smelled of dust, leather, and forgotten stories.
A cat sat on the windowsill, staring at the rain as if deep in thought.
She carefully folded the letter and slipped it into a timeworn envelope.
The sound of waves crashing against the rocks was oddly soothing.
He woke up to find his alarm clock blinking 3:33 AM, though he swore it was morning.
The detective tapped his pen against the desk, piecing together the final clue.
An unexpected gust of wind sent the papers flying across the park.
They watched as the hot air balloon slowly disappeared into the evening sky.
The neon sign flickered, casting eerie shadows on the empty street.
Without a word, she handed him a note that simply read, "Meet me at midnight."
